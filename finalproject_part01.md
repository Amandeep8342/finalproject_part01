QUIZ APP:


I chose an simple online quiz app for my final project. I will use HTML, CSS and javascript to implement this. 
The app will have a very simple structure.
It will be a single page app, one can see a single question at a time on the screen.
In starting , one will have to enter his name to play the quiz.
It will have a four options for the answer and a submit and next button  and also will show the score.
I will use local storage to save the name and score of all the players who will play that quiz.
And it will show the name of player who will at the top in scores.


SCOPE:
Quiz application is becoming a general requirement for all the applications for example if one want to apply for an job
they can be tested by an online quiz to check their ability and on that basis they can be called for an interview.
